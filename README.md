WARNING: if you copy from this and end up

a.) getting caught for cheating/academic integrity violations

or

b.) realizing that I did not get an A+ in this class and a non insignificant amount of these labs and mps do not work 100% correctly

it is not my fault, and I am not liable for you being an idiot and losing points as a result.
